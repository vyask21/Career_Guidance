# Career Guidance
While choosing the right career one should think with respect to their skills, area of interest, abilities and capabilities. This is not as simple a task as it sounds, as most of the students get confused. 

This application is developed to find a solution for all these problems: It is an approach to provide proper guidance to the students by recommending them careers after 10th and 12th grade. The students are evaluated on the basis of the aptitude test.

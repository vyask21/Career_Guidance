      <!--h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 1889</h5-->
      <p class="w3-large" style="text-align:justify">“Good design is a lot like clear thinking made visual” – Edward Tufte

      So, along with clear thinking, if you feel you have what it takes to be a successful fashion designer, you have a career in fashion designing that’s waiting to be explored.

      While in the initial years, fashion was just a concept, today it’s become a way of life for many people. So much so that many want to pursue it as a full-time career. If you ask anyone what is the first thing that comes to their mind when they hear the word ‘fashion’ – runway, models, fancy clothes, etc. are the first things that pop up. But, not just this, fashion designing gives you a way to express your ideas and put it on display for the world to take notice.

      Over the years the fashion industry has grown and how. It has managed to reach the smallest of town and inspired individuals to choose fashion designing for a career. </p>

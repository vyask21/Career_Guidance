      <h1 class="w3-center">Why Should One Opt for Commerce after 10th</h1><br>
      <!--h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 1889</h5-->
      <p class="w3-large" style="text-align:justify">Commerce is one of the popular streams that a student choose after completing their Class 10th board exam. Commerce streams offer students a wide range of career options after completing Class 12th, that will give them a sense of financial security and make them successful.

      The main factor in Commerce is the diversity that this subject offers to the students, and attracts them to pursue higher education in this stream. If the students are excellent with numbers and good in examining and dealing with big numbers and data, have a basic sense in Economics and Finance, then Commerce stream is ideal choice. </p>

      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium" style="text-align:justify">While choosing Commerce students have to make themselves familiar with subjects like Accountancy, Finance, Business Studies, Economics, etc. In today’s scenario, Commerce has become the most favourable career choice in India. Students should start taking Commerce subject seriously and choose the subject after Class 10th.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Career Options for Commerce Students</h1><br>
     
      <p class="w3-large" style="text-align:justify">Commerce directly or indirectly is linked with business, especially with the distribution aspect. Commerce helps in creating a proper distribution channel and creates a market for surplus commodities. It has been already proven that good commerce performs an enormous role in the economic development of a country.

      Some well-defined career opportunities after taking Commerce subject in Class 10th are – Chartered Accountancy, Company Secretary, Business Management, Cost Accountancy, etc. However, students after 10+2 can pursue Chartered Accountancy and Cost Accountancy courses directly, but it is advisable to take first a degree course in B.com along with computer education, to achieve the future goal and make a career successful.

      Students who deal with numbers easily and find it interesting, and who aim to shape their career in financial economics and business (corporate) world should take Commerce.

      Chartered Accountancy or CA is another interesting career options for commerce students. Chartered Accountancy not only gives the benefit for private practice to an adequate chartered accountant but also give them a choice to start their own business.

      Commerce and its education have become the backbone of every nation. The level of growth and the standard of living of the citizens are associated with the state of commerce in every distinct country. No nation can grow without the growth of commerce. The demands of the people are not confined to the goods manufactured in their countries only. They demand goods produced in other nations also.

      These significant points manifest and urge the students to take up Commerce stream.   </p>

A scientific study of any phenomena involves careful observation, formulation of hypotheses, conducting experiments to test and prove the hypotheses and henceforth drawing conclusions that confirm or deny the hypothetical assumption. Such scientific studies help in the formulation of universal laws that help humans to know more about the world we live in and how various natural processes and phenomena occur.</p-->

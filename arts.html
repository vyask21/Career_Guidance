      <!--p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium" style="text-align:justify">Science can be defined as a systematic study and investigation of natural phenomena and occurrences by way of observation, theoretical explanation as well as experimentation. A scientific study of any phenomena involves careful observation, formulation of hypotheses, conducting experiments to test and prove the hypotheses and henceforth drawing conclusions that confirm or deny the hypothetical assumption. Such scientific studies help in the formulation of universal laws that help humans to know more about the world we live in and how various natural processes and phenomena occur.</p-->
